### An Implementation of Distributed Maximal Independent Set with MPICH (DMIS-MPICH)
***

This program is an implemention of [Luby's algorithm](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/0215074), which finds a maximal independent set distributedly, with [MPICH library](https://www.mpich.org/). The program is written with `c++` language.
